SChat

This is a very simple chat made using websockets throught the Event Machine gem. You can open several
browsers and the room will be shared among those. There's only one room at the moment just to make an
example of usage of Web Sockets.

Execute a bundle install to install the (only) gem, and to start the server just run :

$ ruby server.rb

Then open index.html on a browser and thats it. You can open several browsers to connect to same chat.
